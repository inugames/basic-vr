# basic-vr
Extending the default UE4 VR template with basic interactions like in Oculus/SteamVR Home. WIP.

The goal of this project is to add basic VR features to the default UE4 VR map:

- Easy teleport/turn by simply tilting the thumbstick (done)
- Overlay to highlight grabbable actors (done)
- Highlight teleport area
- Laser pointer interaction: grab, move, rotate
- etc.

Check MotionControllerMap, MotionControllerPawn and BP_MotionController for new stuff.
The modified or new parts are commented in Orange.
